        <h2>Vegetation Analysis and Surface Emissivity Mapping</h2>
        <p>The project aimed to analyze vegetation health and surface thermal characteristics 
            over a defined Region of Interest (ROI) using satellite data from the Landsat 8 
            collection. The analysis involved calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation 
            Index (NDVI), Fractional Vegetation Cover (FV), Thermal Infrared Mapping, and 
            Surface Emissivity, visualizing the results on a map. The project was implemented 
            in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using JavaScript.</p>

        <p>Satellite imagery was sourced from the Landsat 8 collection. The imagery was filtered 
            to include only those with less than 1% cloud cover and within the year 2023. The 
            individual images were then merged into a single composite image, representing the 
            median of all images for that period. This composite was clipped to the ROI, so only 
            the relevant part of the imagery was retained.</p>

        <p>NDVI was calculated to assess the health of vegetation within the ROI. It used the 
            difference between the near-infrared and red bands of the satellite imagery to determine 
            the amount of healthy vegetation. Healthy vegetation reflected more near-infrared light 
            and absorbs red light, making NDVI an important metric for environmental monitoring.</p>

        <p>The minimum and maximum NDVI values in the ROI were computed. These values provide insight 
            into the range of vegetation health across the area, from the least vegetated to the most 
            vegetated zones.</p>

        <p>Fractional Vegetation was derived from the NDVI values, representing the fraction of ground 
            covered by vegetation. This gave a more detailed understanding of how much of the area was 
            covered by vegetation rather than just the health of vegetation.</p>

        <p>The project also calculated the surface temperature of the area using thermal infrared data 
            from the satellite. This data helped map temperature variations on the surface, which was 
            useful for identifying hotspots or areas of cooler temperatures.</p>

        <p>Emissivity measured how efficiently the earthâ€™s surface emitted thermal radiation. It was 
            calculated using the Fractional Vegetation data. Higher emissivity values indicated that 
            the surface emitted more radiation, which was essential for understanding the energy balance 
            and climate conditions of the area.</p>

        <p>Lastly, all the calculated layers (NDVI, Fractional Vegetation, Thermal Map, and Surface 
            Emissivity) were visualized on the map. These visualizations provided a comprehensive view 
            of vegetation health, surface temperature variations, and emissivity in the region of interest.
            These results can be used for environmental monitoring, land-use planning, and assessing the 
            effects of climate change on vegetation and surface conditions.</p>
